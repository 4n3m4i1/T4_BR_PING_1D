# T4_BR_PING_1D
This is a library for the Ping 1D sonar manufactured by Blue Robotics  
aimed for use with the Teensy 4.X boards.  
  

At this time only the `READ DISTANCE SIMPLE` command
is supported.  
Expansion will happen over time, but this will not be a priority.


## Installation
This library can be downloaded as a zip and added to your Arduino or  
Teensyduino install via the standard `add library from zip` methods.
